Final project for 6156 Topics In Software Engineering (Spring 2021) - Team Deep Understanding

# All Project Assignments
All project assignments can be found in the 'milestone assignments' folder

# Code, Scripts, Configurations, etc.
Below is a list of scripts we have created/edited for the project. They can be find in the 
+ Edited path to point to obfuscated data: preprocess.sh (code2seq, preprocessing data)
+ Edited path to point to preprocessed data: train.sh (code2seq, model training)
+ Configured hyperparameters: config.py (code2seq, model training)
+ Customized script for submission data: interactive_prediction.py (code2seq)

# Raw Data From Experiments
<TBD>

# Project Overview
We retrained the code2seq model with obfuscated data, used the new model to evalute student submissions from Columbia's 4156 Advanced Software Engineering (Fall 2020) and compared results to that of the original code2seq small-java model.
